# rex

rex is a mere playground where I'm trying to write an engine for parsing, compiling and matching regular expressions.

Consider the code licensed under the MIT license.

## Bugs

* Submatches can not start at the same position.
* Regular expressions matching empty strings do not match empty strings.
